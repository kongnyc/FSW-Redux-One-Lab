# Redux 1 Lab

Adding functionality to a small redux app!

### Standards

- FSW.7.b
- FSW.7.c

### Prerequisites

- React
- Redux

---

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
1. Clone the forked repository to your computer
1. `cd` to the cloned repository
1. `npm install` to install dependencies
1. `npm start` to start the server

## Deliverables

A completed lab. See technical requirements.

## Technical Requirements

Using this skeleton code as a starting point, add the redux code necessary to make this app work.

* Increment should increase the state by 1
* Decrement should decrease the state by 1
* Add another button that resets count to 0

Bonuses:

* Add an input field that lets you set the count to whatever number you type in
* Add a button that only increments if the value is even
* Add a button that only increments if the value is odd
* Add a button that increments one second after it's clicked

You will need to (at a minimum):

* Create the store and pass it into the provider
* Fill out the reducer functionality
* Set up `CounterCountainer` with the necessary selectors and dispatchers
* Figure out the rest!
